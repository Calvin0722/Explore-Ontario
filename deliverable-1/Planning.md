# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

**We are planning to build a geo-audio, real-time locating mobile application that provides natural, cultural, and historical information and anomalies of Ontario parks based users’ interest.** We want to keep in mind that we should design our application to be accessible to people with disabilities. (emphasized by our partner)
**We want to provide information to people who are curious about their surroundings when they are walking in a park.** Is there a park that you visited the most and you would love to learn about the most popular trail but there is no way to know that information? Or is there a time you went to a park and saw a garden of peculiar flowers that you were so curious about but there was no way to learn about them? What about if there is a mobile application that provides all the information that you need based on your interest and curiosity!
There is always endless information around you if you are curious about your surroundings when you are walking in a park. However, it is not always easy to learn about your favorite park because it would be mad to put up signs at every possible place that deserve some showcasing. **Our mobile application will pick up the real time-location from the user. Based on the user’s real-time location, we will present the user with audio and text-based information about the user’s surroundings such as information about plants, historical sites, animals, tourist attractions, etc.** Users can customize the application based on their interest. For example, if a user only wants to learn about the surrounding plants, our application will only provide audio and text-based information about the surrounding plants. If a user is a history fanatic, our application will only provide audio and text-based information about the surrounding historical sites.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria.
