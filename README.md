# Ontario Park

## Description

Ontario Park is a geo-audio and realtime-locating mobile application that provides natural, cultural, and historical information and anomalies of Ontario parks based usersâ€™ interest. Our application aims to solve the problem of a lack of access of information of your surrounding when you are walking in parks.

Imagine walking in a part and seeing a beautiful plant or am amazing architecture but you have no resource to learn about what is that beautiful plant or what is the background story of that amazing architecture. Our application will provide you with that information as you are walking in the park!

To simplify the limit the scope of our problem statement, we focus on providing natural, cultural, and historical information in High Park.

## Backend

Please go into the directory title `Backend` if you want to look at our API references.

## Development requirements

### Front End Development Installing

**developer need to do installation both on the mobile device and PC to run the application**.

#### Installation on PC

install Node js in the local machine.

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

install expo in the local machine (Windows):

```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

install expo in the local machine (Linux/MacOS):

```
sudo npm install expo-cli --global
```

Clone this repository to local machine.

```
https://github.com/csc301-fall-2020/team-project-15-ontario-parks.git
```

change directory on terminal to the project front end location and run npm i to install all the dependency.

```
cd <project_location>
cd ./deliverable-2/MobileFrontend/OntarioPark
npm i
```

### Installing on mobile device

**ios device:**

- open app store on the device and download _Expo Client_.

**android device:**

- open Google Play store on the device and download _Expo_.

### Backend Development Installing:

- Install Node.js on your local machine.
- Step into the backend project directory and run `npm install` in terminal
- Run `npm start` in terminal

## Deployment and Github Workflow

- Frontend:

  We made a branch called MobileUI where the mobile frontend development takes place. Each member in the frontend team is responsible for one or two screens and we allocate the rest of the work(such as connection with backend) in a case by case manner. This allows us to prevent conflicts since we are working on different part of the same code base.

  We tried to make pull requests on the MobileUI branch for parts and any other team member who reviews the code can merge it. However, we are not able to continue using this because of our time constraint and because all of our components are closely related and need to interact between each other. We are planning to adopt the workflow described above in Phase 3 as we will be adding new features rather than creating everything all at once.

  We chose camel case for our naming as this is the standard for javascript.

  As we are developing React Native application using Expo, we are able to view the live application as we are writing and modifying the code and that is our deployment process when writing code. Expo also acts as a package manager and provides us the ability to link resources automatically and provide service for building and deploying the application as an apk file. We only use Expo to deploy to apk when we are finished because, as stated above, we are able to see live updates on our simulator/device when developing.

  We chose the workflow using pull request because it adds another guard towards erroneous code and prevents it from merging into more important branches. However, this is also why we did not employ it for the same reason as we are all writing code that are interdependent. We used Expo for our deployment because it offers features such as ability to see the update to the application directly on the phone that substantially improves our efficiency when making changes.

- Backend:

  Each team member in the backend team is responsible for handling one portion of the backend application. Ka Chun Mo first setup the code and the folder structure of the backend application, connected the application to our database (MongoDB), and hosted the application on heroku. Zhiyuan Sun then implemented the API of our application. Wang Ting Shu is responsible for setting up the crucial part of storing our audio and image files in our DigitalOcean server. Since we divided our tasks in a sequential manner, there is no conflicts in our backend applications.

## Licenses

- Currently we choose not to have an open source licence because of two reasons:

  Our partner is not in the tech industry and may not understand the implication of open sourcing.
  
  Ontario Parks is a government institution and we do not understand the requirements and implication of this fact on open sourcing.
